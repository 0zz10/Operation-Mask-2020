# Operation Mask 2020

**Operation Name:** Opeartion-Mask-2020

**Action Order:** Mask is a MUST.

**Mission Data:** 2020-01-31 - unknown

**Operation Information:**
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), also known as the Wuhan coronavirus, is a contagious virus that causes respiratory infection and has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission, first identified by authorities in Wuhan, Hubei, China, as the cause of the ongoing 2019â€“20 Wuhan coronavirus outbreak.

This operation is immediately taken into action to make necessary medical precaution for further virus transmission as well as medical treatment to current patients.

The following project is **a real-time temperature measurement/mask-wearing detection disease control system**, built on Raspberry Pi 4B, PiCamera, IR temperature sensor, Google Cloud Platform (AutoML Vision, Storage, Big Query, Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions), digital segment display, and LCD display. The programming tools are pythons and TensorFlow Lite.
